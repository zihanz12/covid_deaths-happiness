# Project Proposal
1. Visualize the life satisfaction (happiness index) across the globe. (in file [zihanzhou_r](https://github.com/illinois-stat447/fa21-prj-shiyuan8-sw20-zihanz12-zl32/tree/master/zihanzhou_r), done by Zihan Zhou)
2. Visualize the trend of Covid-19 cases and mortality rates, and combine the world happiness with total Covid-19 cases and deaths. (in file [covid-deaths](https://github.com/illinois-stat447/fa21-prj-shiyuan8-sw20-zihanz12-zl32/tree/master/covid-deaths), done by Shiyuan Wang)
3. Combine the world happiness with vaccination rate, and visualize the correlation between Covid-19 vaccination rates and world happiness. (in [file vaccination](https://github.com/illinois-stat447/fa21-prj-shiyuan8-sw20-zihanz12-zl32/tree/master/vaccination), done by Kimmy Liu)
4. Use Anova analysis to figure the impacts of Covid-19 cases, deaths, vaccination rates and different factors across fields, such as public policy, public health, economics etc. on the happiness index. (in file [songyuan](https://github.com/illinois-stat447/fa21-prj-shiyuan8-sw20-zihanz12-zl32/tree/master/songyuan), done by Songyuan Wang)
5. Explore as many R packages as we can.
